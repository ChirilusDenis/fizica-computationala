This is a homework for computational physics, containing 4 problems.

1.The first problem was the simulation of a balisctic missle, with regards to air resistance,  thrust produced by the rocket and the changing mass of the rocket.

2.The second problem was the simulation of 3 bodies,  tied with elastic bonds.

3.The third problem was the simulation of a pendulum, using the lagrangian to calculate the pendulum's position.

4.The last problem was the simulation of a box with gas particles, each particle having a random angle, and the speeds of the particles follow a Maxwell distribution.

All other files are the labs on which the 4 homeworks are based on.
